3,more like funchuck,"Gave this to my dad for a gag gift after directing ""Nunsense,"" he got a reall kick out of it!"
5,Inspiring,"I hope a lot of people hear this cd. We need more strong and positive vibes like this. Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness. Her blues is from the gut. The pop sounds are catchy and mature."
5,The best soundtrack ever to anything.,"I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
4,Chrono Cross OST,"The music of Yasunori Misuda is without question my close second below the great Nobuo Uematsu.Chrono Cross OST is a wonderful creation filled with rich orchestra and synthesized sounds. While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous. Some of my favourite tracks include; ""Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World""."
5,Too good to be true,Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!! BUY IT NOW!!
5,There's a reason for the price,"There's a reason this CD is so expensive, even the version that's not an import.Some of the best music ever. I could listen to every track every minute of every day. That's about all i can say."
1,Buyer beware,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
4,"Errors, but great story","I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway. I have to say I love it. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in two hours. I say buy it. I say read it. It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today. We spend too much time looking at the faults of others. I also enjoyed beloved.Sincerly,Jaylynn R"
1,The Worst!,"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
1,Oh please,"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
1,Awful beyond belief!,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
4,A romantic zen baseball comedy,"When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
5,Lower leg comfort for 12 hours +,"Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight, not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care)."
3,Delivery was very long wait.....,It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings. The Sun Bronze pair fits okay but quality is less than the pair I bought at an actual compression store.
2,sizes recomended in the size chart are not real,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
3,Overbury,Full of intrigue and a good overview of the court of James 1 and the key players. Provides a good general history of all the facts of the case.
1,Another Abysmal Digital Copy,"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
4,Wardell's book is a pure delight.,"Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's ""Generation X"". Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of ""Western culture"" - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them."
4,i liked this album more then i thought i would,"I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
3,Better than I thought.,"I wrote a harsh review based on hearing a couple of tracks from one album,but after hearing tracks from the other 3 albums,I have to say that I take it back and in fact I bought it.The other albums are very good value for money with good liner notes and some very good music.Well worth the money for Roy Orbison fans."
3,The great Roy Orbison deserves a better quality recording .,"When I saw the term 'bootleg' on the title of this recording,I can see what they mean because one cd does have a slightly disappointing sound,but the others do sound much better.Having seen the great Roy Orbison twice live in concert,I know that he sounded better,but overall it is a good value for money 4cd set with good liner notes."
2,Problem with charging smaller AAAs,"I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
5,CHECK OUT THE K6000 CHARGER!,Greetings. Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries. Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes. The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET. Good bye.
5,ahhh,"These will more than pay for themselves, they are perfect for my GPS which will drain a cheap battery in less than an hour.btw the charger did come with 1850 batteries."
5,Excellent Product,This is an excellent product. I bought this for my digital camera. It has a great battery life per charge. Charger is handy to carry.
1,Batteries died within a year ...,"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
5,"To ""Disappointed"" in Miami","You said ""...but the charge only lasts a very short time.""Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised."
5,Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book,"It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne"
4,Excellent choice for combination,"After reading several reviews on this item, I purchased it as a Christmas gift. My brother liked it a lot, so I decided to get one for my wife and me. I'm really glad I did. It's pretty easy to set up and use, and the playback is excellent in both the VCR and DVD modes. The remote also operates my JVC TV. This is a great choice if you're looking for a quality combination player from a trusted name in electronics."
4,Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
3,Good player but wish I could change a few things,"Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents."
2,DVD Player crapped out after one year,"I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot."
5,"Very Happy - Has ""Random"" capability for MP3s","I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select ""random"" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality."
3,"Great DVD, mediocre VCR","This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here."
5,This is a very good book for students and engineers.,"Many useful concepts of digital compression can be found in this book. It is easy to read and understand, especially for students and engineers in EE."
3,Comprehensive but marred by poor printing,"This book appears to be a ""print on demand"" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the ""muddy"" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing."
5,Great reference book for its topic,"It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
4,"large volume,not enough proof, introductory, good organizati","It seems that authors have pictures unrelated to content of the text repeatedly printed. It does not cover major topics, such as .gif/ graphic file compression. On the positive side it is well-written, organized, multiple equation in some chapters, descriptive in others. Very little mathematical proof."
1,"should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle""","The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
5,Here is a little secret.,"After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are. If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5. But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act."
3,"A Good Show, But I'm Kind of Annoyed. . .","I love this show, however, there are 14 episodes in the first season and this DVD only shows the first eight. This is kind of annoying as the best episodes happen towards the end of the season. I hope the BBC will release another DVD that contains all the episodes, but for now this one is still somewhat enjoyable."
2,"Not an ""ultimate guide""","Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
4,It works,What can I say? It works. This helped me when applying to law schools. A great guide to utilize. Cutting a great score on the LSAT is just part of the equation to get into law school.
1,Nothing you don't already know,"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
3,Door hanger review,"This looked like a great project for the kids and very cute and attractive. The markers did not write on the hanger without wiping off and this was disappointing to the kids. Great idea and set, just need markers that work for it."
5,Rochelle explains It All for You,"Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
5,Spreading a Passion for God,"Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews, but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous ""christian leaders"" today."
1,Doesn't work on a Mac,"It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
5,supermarionation attack!,"if you love thunderbirds or any of anderson's productions,you will love this cd! a collection of songs from and inspired from his fab shows from the 60's thru today long live gerry!"
3,Good for what it is,"As a recipe book, this isn't all that great. The waffles are pretty good and the biscuits are enjoyable (especially with some whole wheat flour mixed in), but overall there aren't that many recipes.I enjoyed the writing style and anecdotes, but I was hoping for more recipes.On the positive side, the author does not make the reader feel that using sourdough is difficult or mysterious, but makes it attainable for the novice."
4,Alaska Sourdough Book Reivew,"We purchased this book based on a recommendation to create our own sourdough ""start"". The book is detailed and very informative. We have enjoyed creating our own sourdough start. It is amazing that you should leave the sourdough start on the counter for up to a year to have a stronger flavor."
2,Maybe I got a bad one.,"My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
1,TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
2,*** BEWARE ***,"This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying."
5,Excellent Service,Recieved this item in very fast time. was perfectely happy with shipper and sylvania lcd tv is excellent buy and works perfect. would do business with shipper anytime.
5,Dk Travel guides,"The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that."
4,"nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides","The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide."
2,Not the best,"I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
3,If it's Tuesday it must be Belgium,"This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a ""buffet"" tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...)."
1,Not!,"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
4,Modern Traditional Point of View,"The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures."
4,Book is great - Purchase misleading !,"I have no quarrel with the book itself. Wanted a copy for a long time. However, I purchased a used book with the understanding that it was a ""Signed Copy."" The copy I received WAS NOT autographed. This is a disappointment. If you advertise it as an autographed copy, don't substitute one that isn't. Leaves me in serious doubt regarding furture purchases. I'd appreciate some clarification. Regards, Elmer Kurrus"
2,Disappointing,"The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
1,Very poor quality.,"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
2,Scraped across the whole top.,"Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen."
2,Didn't live up to expectations.,"I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
5,creativity for everyone,did you know this software has been arwarded for parents choice arward 2002 i try this software and it's1# creativity for girls to imspire art in time.
3,ADVENTURE NEEDS MORE!!,"I thought this was a good game. However it was really short, and that made it not as enjoyable as I was hoping it would have been.Overall is a good game but it needs a longer storyline to it!"
5,Wonderful Game,"Got the game for my daughter when she was four and she LOVES it. She finished it rather quickly and the games are not particularly difficult or educational, but she still occasionally likes to play it. It's a beautiful game. I wrote this review because the game froze on us as well. I had to update our video card driver and it has worked perfectly since. Hope this helps."
3,Probably Won't Become Your Favorite Barbie Game,This Rapunzel game was not really my favorite game. It wasn't that much fun. You have to wait a long time to move to another place. And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down. This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at. I would not recommend that you would buy this game. I would rather play princess fashion boutique.
4,very entertaining and worth the money,"I bought this software for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas. She and her twin sister, along with their 4-year old sister, LOVE this game!!! They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end. I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a ""fun"" game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name. The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game. They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time. I think it was totally worth the money."
3,"Over all, an okay game","My daughters have both enjoyed playing this game. One of them is 6 yrs. old and the other is 3 1/2 yrs. old. and they both have had no trouble mastering this game. The down side to this game is that it is redundant/repeatitive. It is the same things over and over again, only you can change the patterns and colors of the items you are working on. In order to be able to play again after you have completed it, you must go and remove their name from the sign-in page 'then' retype it! This little chore is very annoying after awhile. The graphics are very nice and colorful and it does allow your child to use her imagination and to be creative, but all in all , I think the game was way too pricey for what it is. After having this in our house for 4 months, my girls have become rather bored with it."
5,NYTimes Likes IT,"BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course."
1,Bad Deal!!,"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
3,doesn't last,very light scent that doesn't last very long. pretty bottle but I was hoping for more of a freesia scent. which it was not.
2,audio options non existent,"While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
3,Have yet to watch it yet.,I bought this movie to watch with my Thai girlfriend and did not get teh chance. She told me kn the phone she was watching it.She seemed to Enjoy it overall. When is howed this one and 1-2 to her she said its not for her. She lieks scary movies but this one did not apeal to her.Well she did watch it and enjoyed it. I wont get to watch it untill Aug. But i am looking forward to it.I gave the 3 star because i have not seen it. I would have givin it a 1 or a 2. It was moved to a three because of my girl friends opinon. First she said not for her than she said good movie. So it changed her mind.I am looking forward to it though
5,Hamelin does it again,"I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too."
4,Leap Frog Math Whiz Learning Bus Tray Puzzle,"This is an excellent learning tool. It starts with basic shapes, then numbers, and then addition and subtraction. All done in a simple puzzle format. Wonderful to use one on one with two to four year olds. The whole concept is very basic, but the skills are extremely necessary and this is a great start."
3,weak,"I had very high expectations for this book. Never having been to the national portrait gallery I wasn't sure what to expect but I thought it would be the pinnacle of portraiture. I was completely dissapointed to see the poor quality of work by well known and unknown artists alike.There are of course exceptions but they are few and far between. I gave it 3 stars because the text is excellent, it's well laid out and very fun to read."
